Autonomous-Vehicle-Assistance-Simulation (AVAS)
Overview
The Autonomous Vehicle Assistance Simulation (AVAS) is a pioneering project developed for the McMaster Engineering Programming Competition 2023. This simulation demonstrates advanced features in autonomous vehicle technology, focusing on route optimization, pedestrian safety, and driver assistance. Due to the intense nature of the competition, with only a 6-hour window for creation and submission, the project is highly commendable, though not without areas for improvement.

Information About the Competition
Summary: The McMaster Engineering Programming Competition 2023 centered on developing innovative solutions for autonomous vehicles.
